## 📋 What You Need to Do Next

### Step 1: Configure Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to your Supabase project: https://app.supabase.com
2. Navigate to: **Authentication** → **Providers** → **Azure**
3. Enable the Azure provider
4. Enter your Azure credentials:
   - **Application (client) ID**: `<your-application-id>`
   - **Azure Secret**: `<your-secret-value>`
   - **Azure Tenant ID**: `<your-tenant-id>`
5. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Create Environment File

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration (required)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_OR_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

# Azure Configuration (optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_AZURE_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
```

Get your Supabase URL and anon key from: **Supabase Dashboard** → **Settings** → **API**

### Step 3: Verify Azure Redirect URI

In Azure Portal, verify your app registration has the correct redirect URI:
```
https://<your-supabase-project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
```

### Step 4: Test the Integration

1. Start your dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/auth/login

3. Test both authentication methods:
   - Email/Password (should work as before)
   - Sign in with Microsoft (new)

4. Verify successful redirect to `/protected/templates` after login

## 🔍 How to Test Microsoft Login

1. Click "Sign in with Microsoft" button
2. You'll be redirected to Microsoft's login page
3. Enter your Azure AD credentials
4. Grant consent if prompted
5. You'll be redirected back to your app
6. You should land on `/protected/templates` page, logged in

## 📝 Important Notes

### Authentication Methods
- **Email/Password**: Existing flow unchanged, works as before
- **Microsoft Azure AD**: New optional method, creates Supabase user on first login

### User Accounts
- Azure AD and email/password users are separate accounts (unless emails match)
- Each user can have only one authentication method per email
- First login with Azure AD automatically creates a Supabase user

### Session Management
- Both methods use the same session management
- Logout works identically for both
- Session cookies are handled by Supabase

## 🚀 Files Modified

```
components/login-form.tsx          - Added Microsoft SSO button
app/api/auth/callback/route.ts     - Added OAuth callback handler
AZURE_AD_SETUP.md                  - Setup and troubleshooting guide
IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md          - This file
```

## 🔐 Security Checklist

- ✅ Client secrets stored only in Supabase (not in code)
- ✅ OAuth flow uses PKCE via Supabase
- ✅ Session cookies are HTTP-only
- ✅ Redirect URIs are validated
- ⚠️ Don't commit `.env.local` to git (add to .gitignore)

## 📚 Next Steps

1. Configure Supabase with your Azure credentials
2. Create `.env.local` file with required values
3. Test both authentication methods
4. Deploy to production (update redirect URIs)
5. Monitor authentication logs
